                  <h2> Introduction </h2>

                  <p>
                        Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, the Ottoman Empire instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian deaths - actions widely recognized as
                        constituting genocide.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        Armenia remains involved in the protracted struggle with Azerbaijan over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily ethnic Armenian region that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an autonomous oblast within Soviet Azerbaijan.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth.
